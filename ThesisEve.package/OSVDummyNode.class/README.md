A dummy node does not provide any functionality whatsoever.
Its main purpose is to provide a unique instance to be used where a Node is required as a model.
An example can be found in the root node RTElements, where we use a DummyNode as a model to the group.
The root node itself is used as a model for the bounding box element.
